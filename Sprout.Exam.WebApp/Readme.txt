Q - If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or
an architectural design

A - At this stage, there is no pagination facility available at UI where employees are displayed. The priority should be on creating paginatoon functionality for better user experience.
This functionality can further be extended to sorting Employees by diffrent properties like Name, Type, DOB etc.
